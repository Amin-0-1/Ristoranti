## Architecture

This project follows the Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator (MVVM-C) architecture pattern for a clean and maintainable codebase. Here's a brief overview of the components:

- **Model**: Represents the data structure of the application.
- **View**: Displays the UI and binds to ViewModels.
- **ViewModel**: Handles business logic and exposes data to the View.
- **Coordinator**: Manages navigation and flow between screens.

The project also employs Clean Architecture principles to separate concerns and promote testability.
